# Halo Is Here: Brilliant Labs Unveils Their AI Glasses Revolution

If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you already know how *deeply* we fell for the **Frame**. We praised its openness, its audacity, and its role pushing the “smart glasses as platform” narrative forward. Now, Brilliant Labs has officially dropped its successor—**Halo**—and yes, we are absolutely buzzing with excitement.

---

## 1. The Big Announcement & First Impressions

On July 31st, Brilliant Labs revealed Halo: a sleek, open-source AI glasses platform with a set of features that feel like a bold next chapter rather than just an incremental upgrade.

What makes this moment so electrifying is how Halo builds on everything we loved in Frame—while introducing brand-new capabilities that feel *future-forward*. If Frame whispered promise, Halo shouts possibility.

---

## 2. What’s New & What’s Upgraded

Here’s what Halo brings to the table:

- **AI Agent (Noa, upgraded)**: A multimodal AI assistant that understands what you *see* and *hear* in real time.  
- **Narrative Memory**: A patent-pending system that lets Noa remember names, conversations, and visual cues for later recall.  
- **Vibe Mode**: Experimental feature where you can generate apps on the fly just by asking. No app stores—just voice.  
- **Display / Optics**: A 0.2-inch color micro-OLED panel projecting a retro, arcade-style UI into your peripheral vision.  
- **Lightweight Build**: Just over 40g, with up to 14 hours of battery life.  
- **Enhanced Hardware**: Optical AI inference sensor, dual mics, 6-axis IMU, bone conduction speakers.  
- **Vision Options**: Adjustable optics (+2 to –6 diopters) and partnerships for prescription/sunglass lenses.  

In short: Halo keeps the open spirit of Frame, but supercharges AI, memory, and user experience.

---

## 3. Why We’re Especially Fired Up

Longtime readers will know how much we admired Frame. Its quirks made it loveable, but its ambition made it legendary. With Halo, Brilliant Labs is going even further:

- From “smart glasses that help you see and translate” → to “glasses that *think with* you.”  
- Vibe Mode is a gutsy experiment we can’t wait to try.  
- The specs feel shockingly mature: 40g weight, 14h battery, full-color micro-OLED display.  
- And most importantly—it remains **open, hackable, and developer friendly**.  

If Frame was the opening act, Halo is the headliner.

---

## 4. The Memory System

One of the most exciting features of Halo is its **Narrative Memory** system. Unlike traditional smart glasses that only process information in the moment, Halo’s memory architecture allows its AI assistant, Noa, to actually *remember* what you’ve seen, heard, and discussed across time. This means names, faces, past conversations, and even contextual visual details can be recalled later—transforming Noa from a reactive tool into a proactive companion. Imagine meeting someone briefly and, weeks later, being able to ask your glasses, “Who was that again?” and instantly get the answer. Brilliant Labs has emphasized that all of this is handled through privacy-conscious design, with raw data converted into abstract representations. The result is a memory system that feels deeply personal, useful, and futuristic, without the dystopian overtones we often associate with “always-on” recording devices. In short, Narrative Memory is Halo’s secret weapon—the feature that could make it indispensable in daily life rather than just another gadget. I for one cannot wait to see how it works.

## 5. Pricing, Availability & Subscription

- **Price**: $299 USD for pre-orders, rising to $349 after November 1st.  
- **Subscription**: Noa+ at $19.99/month for expanded memory, coding, and usage.  
- **Shipping**: First units expected Q4 2025, likely November.  
- **Note**: Stock will be limited at launch, so early pre-orders matter.  

---

## 6. The Bigger Picture

Halo signals something bigger: AI glasses are moving beyond curiosity into genuine, everyday utility.  

- **Narrative memory** sets a new bar.  
- **Vibe Mode** hints at a future beyond app stores.  
- **Open development** means innovation won’t be locked down.  

Competitors will have to catch up—and rethink what wearable AI even means.

---

## 7. Final Thoughts

Halo is more than an update. It’s a declaration. For those of us who’ve been cheering on the Frames since day one, Halo feels like the dream being realized in real hardware.  

We can’t wait to put it through its paces, explore Noa’s memory, and see if Vibe Mode lives up to its wild potential. Stay tuned—this is just the beginning.
