## 2. Digital Etiquette and Awareness

Wearing AR glasses on a date raises questions of attention and etiquette:

- **Transparency matters**: If you’re using features like navigation or info lookup, let your date know.

## 3. Enhancing Shared Experiences

AR can **augment date activities**:

## 4. Privacy Considerations

Social interactions, especially early dating, involve sensitive boundaries:

- **Consent is crucial**: Recording or sharing features must be explicitly agreed upon.

- **Trust-building**: Clear recording indicators and visible AR usage signals help maintain comfort and confidence.

Being mindful about privacy strengthens **social trust and connection**.

## 5. The Subtle Impact on Dynamics

Even without direct interaction, AR glasses influence perceptions:

- **Tech-savvy impression**: Demonstrates curiosity and engagement with new technology.  
- **Potential intimidation**: Overly advanced features can feel intimidating or distancing if misused.  
- **Balancing utility and charm**: Integrating AR naturally into conversation or shared activities works best.

The goal is **enhancement without overshadowing genuine connection**.
