# Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses Unveiled

At Meta Connect 2025, Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the **Meta Ray-Ban Display**, marking a significant advancement in augmented reality eyewear.

## Key Features

### In-Lens Display

The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses feature a **full-color, high-resolution display** embedded in the right lens. This display allows users to:

- **Check messages** and **preview photos**
- **View translations** and receive assistance from Meta AI
- **Access notifications** and **navigate** using turn-by-turn directions

The display is designed to be unobtrusive, appearing only when needed and disappearing when not in use, ensuring users remain connected without being distracted.

### Meta Neural Band

Accompanying the glasses is the **Meta Neural Band**, a wristband that reads electrical muscle signals (sEMG) to interpret subtle hand gestures. This technology enables users to control the glasses with minimal movement, offering a hands-free interaction model that is both discreet and efficient. The wristband is lightweight and offers up to **18 hours of battery life**, charging separately from the glasses.

### Design and Battery Life

The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are available in two colors: **Black** and **Sand**, and come in two frame sizes: standard and large. They feature **TransitionsÂ® lenses**, allowing for comfortable wear both indoors and outdoors. The glasses provide up to **6 hours of mixed-use battery life**, with the collapsible charging case offering an additional **24 hours**, totaling **30 hours** of usage.

International availability is expected to expand to Canada, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom in early 2026.
