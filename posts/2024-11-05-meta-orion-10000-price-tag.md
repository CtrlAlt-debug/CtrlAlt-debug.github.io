# Meta Orion's $10,000 Price Tag: A Glimpse into the Future of AR

At Meta's Connect 2024 event, the company unveiled its most advanced augmented reality (AR) prototype to date: the **Orion AR glasses**. While the glasses showcase cutting-edge technology, they also come with a significant caveat—a production cost of approximately **$10,000 per unit**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## The Technology Behind the Price

The steep production cost is primarily attributed to the use of **silicon carbide lenses**, a material known for its high refractive index and optical clarity. These lenses enable a **70° field of view**, providing a more immersive AR experience. However, the manufacturing process for these lenses is complex and yields are currently low, making them expensive to produce. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

In addition to the lenses, the Orion glasses require a **neural wristband** for gesture control and a **wireless compute puck** for processing, further adding to the overall cost. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Meta's Strategic Approach

Despite the impressive capabilities of the Orion AR glasses, Meta has decided not to release them to the public at this time. Instead, the company is focusing on refining the technology and reducing production costs. The goal is to develop a more affordable version that can be brought to market in the coming years.

Mark Zuckerberg envisions a future where AR glasses like Orion could replace smartphones, offering users a seamless blend of the physical and digital worlds. However, achieving this vision will require overcoming significant technical and financial challenges. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Looking Ahead

While the $10,000 price tag places Orion out of reach for most consumers, it serves as an important step in the evolution of AR technology. The insights gained from this prototype will inform future developments, potentially leading to more accessible and practical AR devices.

As Meta continues to invest in AR research and development, the dream of widespread adoption of AR glasses moves closer to reality. However, the path forward will require innovation, efficiency, and a keen understanding of consumer needs and expectations.

Stay tuned for more updates as we follow the journey of Meta's Orion AR glasses and the broader AR industry.
