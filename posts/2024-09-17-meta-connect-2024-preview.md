# Meta Connect 2024: What to Expect (Before the Curtains Open)

It’s that time of year again — Meta’s marquee XR/AI/AR event is looming on the calendar. The rumor mills are running full tilt, leaks are popping up, and industry watchers everywhere are squinting into the future, trying to guess what Meta will unveil.

Here’s what seems likely (and what would genuinely shake things up) for **Meta Connect 2024**.

---

## What We Know Already  

Meta has dropped a few hints and leaks, so we’re not going in blind:

- Meta is expected to unveil **Orion**, its long-teased AR glasses prototype, which could be a major turning point for the company’s XR ambitions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Updates to AI features across Meta’s platforms — Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook — are also anticipated. The company is pushing hard on integrating AI as a backbone feature, not just a side trick. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- On the hardware front: the **Quest 3S** is expected to get a refresh or re-emphasis in Meta’s lineup. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Some signals point to Meta doubling down on developer tools and software ecosystems, not just flashy gadgets. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

So the stage is set. But what’s more speculative — and more fun to guess — is where Meta might try to surprise us.

## What I’m Watching Closely  

### 1. A Consumer-Ready AR Glasses Reveal  
Orion is probably still a prototype (teased, developmental), but Meta might use Connect to show something closer to a consumer product — a version of AR glasses with enough polish to hint it’s not just a lab toy anymore. If they can pull that off, it’ll be a statement.  

### 2. On-Device AI Upgrades  
If Meta can move more of its AI features to run locally (on device) rather than relying entirely on cloud processing, that would be a meaningful shift. Reduced latency, better privacy — these are big wins if they land.

### 3. Developer APIs & Third-Party Ecosystem  
I expect Meta to open more doors for external developers. A strong AR ecosystem means not just glasses but a platform. Toolkits, SDKs, early access — these will matter more long term than glamorous demos.

### 4. Smarter Integration Across Apps  
Meta owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp. AI features that fluidly cross between services — visual search in Instagram that leads to WhatsApp sharing, or AR layers connecting to Messenger — would show Meta thinks in systems, not silos.

### 5. Surprise Curveballs  
Maybe something unexpected: gesture control tech, advanced optics (microLED in lenses?), new sensors, or a pivot to mixed-reality features we hadn’t anticipated. I won’t bet against it — Meta’s track record shows they like to throw the odd curve.

## What Could Trip Them Up  

- **Overpromise, underdeliver**: If the demos aren’t convincing in real-world lighting or with battery constraints, critics will pounce.  
- **Hardware constraints**: AR glasses are still punishing to build. Weight, heat, display clarity — those challenges don’t vanish overnight.  
- **AI bottlenecks & cloud dependence**: If most “smart” behavior still needs a server, user experience might lag.  
- **Ecosystem imbalance**: If developers can’t build for it easily, or if Meta restricts too many capabilities, adoption might stall.

## Why This Matters  

Meta Connect has never been just about gadgets. It’s about vision — how Meta sees the next decade of computing. If it nails this outing, it could shift the direction of AR/AI competition. If it stumbles, skeptics will circle.

Personally, I’m excited. Because beyond the leaks and speculation, there’s a chance Meta shows something that feels *less like a prototype* and *more like a product we might actually live with*. That’s when the real magic starts.

Stay tuned — in a few days, we’ll know which guesses were wishful thinking and which ones hit the mark.
