# Meta Connect 2025 Preview Leaks: Hypernova Glasses Rumors

As Meta prepares for its annual Connect conference, scheduled for September 17â€“18, 2025, leaked information has begun to surface about the company's upcoming smart glasses, codenamed *Hypernova*. These glasses are expected to mark a significant leap in augmented reality (AR) wearables, combining advanced display technology with innovative gesture control.

## What We Know So Far

### Heads-Up Display

The Hypernova glasses are rumored to feature a **waveguide display** embedded in the right lens. This display will allow users to view notifications, navigation directions, and interact with apps directly within their field of vision. Unlike previous models that relied on audio feedback, the inclusion of a visual display aims to provide a more immersive and intuitive user experience.

### Neural Wristband Controller

A standout feature of the Hypernova glasses is the **Meta Neural Band**, a wristband that reads electrical muscle signals (sEMG) to interpret subtle hand gestures. This technology enables users to control the glasses with minimal movement, offering a hands-free interaction model that is both discreet and efficient. The wristband is expected to be lightweight, with a battery life of up to 18 hours, and will charge separately from the glasses.

### Software and Integration

The Hypernova glasses will run on a customized version of **Meta Horizon OS**, optimized for AR applications. Pre-installed apps are expected to include Meta AI, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, and Maps, providing a seamless integration with Meta's ecosystem. The glasses will also support real-time features such as live captions, translations, and turn-by-turn navigation.

## Design and Pricing

In terms of design, the Hypernova glasses are said to resemble the classic **Ray-Ban Wayfarer** style but with a slightly thicker frame to accommodate the new technology. They will be available in two colors: Black and Sand, and in two frame sizes: standard and large. The glasses are expected to be priced at **$799**, which includes both the glasses and the Meta Neural Band. A collapsible charging case will provide an additional 24 hours of battery life, bringing the total to 30 hours.

## Release and Availability

The Meta Hypernova glasses are slated for release in the United States on **September 30, 2025**, at select retailers including Best Buy, LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, and Ray-Ban stores, with Verizon locations following soon after. International availability is expected to expand to Canada, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom in early 2026.

## Final Thoughts

With the Hypernova glasses, Meta aims to redefine the AR wearables market by integrating advanced display technology with intuitive gesture control. While the $799 price point may be a barrier for some, the combination of features and design could make these glasses a compelling option for early adopters and tech enthusiasts. As we approach the official unveiling at Meta Connect 2025, all eyes will be on how these glasses perform in real-world scenarios and whether they can live up to the hype.
